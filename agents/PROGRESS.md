## 2026-11-03 — sprint cycle — no new tasks
- Agent: orchestrator · Attempts: — · PR: — · Jira: KAN-24 → Ready to merge (description PR link + pm-lead comment)
- Summary: push access verified. No human review or untagged comment on #2/#9 or Jira since the last agent commits. Only queued work was RET-1 PM review (APPROVE, see entry below). No new task: ai-engineer and backend-engineer each have one open PR; FE-1 needs npm, still unreachable.
- Blockers / follow-ups: Mahesh to review/merge #2 then #9 (re-run #9 CI after #2), then arxivlens-agents#2.

## 2026-11-03 — RET-1 — in review
- Agent: backend-engineer (build), qa-reviewer, pm-lead · Attempts: 1 · Review rounds: QA 1 (PASS) · PM 1 (APPROVE) · PR: https://github.com/MaheshPulivarthi18/ArxivLens/pull/9 · Jira KAN-24
- Summary: `search.go` reranks a `max(20, limit)` RRF pool in one call, stable-sorts by rerank score and truncates. It falls back to RRF order with a trace-ID log and no content in the log. `rerank=false`, the SQL and the errors are unchanged. 391 lines, CI 4/4 green, 17/17 QA mutants caught. Raised for review with evidence in the description.
- Blockers / follow-ups: merge after #2. The p95/eval measurement is deferred to EVAL-2 AC10 (PM decision). The §7.1 diagram docs PR merges after #9. After #9: AGENTS.md §6 gotcha rules PR. Backend nits: `context.Canceled` and `±Inf` tests.

## 2026-11-02 — RET-1 — design approved
- Agent: pm-lead · Attempts: 1 · Review rounds: 0 (design gate) · PR: —
- Summary: Approved `docs/design/RET-1.md` with 8 binding conditions (SQL literal stays identical in `search.go`, no extra `LIMIT 50` text; run EVAL-1's parity test against the branch and paste output; no OTel import; unexported trace-ID helpers; grep-able log; error messages unchanged). Checked the parity test concretely: the refactor keeps it green, but a stray `LIMIT 50` comment breaks it and a moved file passes silently.
- Blockers / follow-ups: AI-4 (ai-engineer, P2, blocked on RET-1 + EVAL-1 merge). AC7 PRD §7.1 diagram docs PR by pm-lead at final review.

## 2026-11-02 — EVAL-1 — in review (ready to merge)
- Agent: ai-engineer (build) · pm-lead (review) · Attempts: 3 · QA rounds: 3 (PASS → FAIL → PASS) · PM rounds: 2 (APPROVE overturned by human review → APPROVE) · PR: https://github.com/MaheshPulivarthi18/ArxivLens/pull/2 · Jira KAN-8
- Summary: all 4 items from Mahesh's review closed at `d83a4c0`: paper-level Recall@5 (ADR-0006), production cross-encoder in the ADR-0010 ordering, per-paper/per-model coverage, KAN-8 linked in place of an issue. pm-lead rewrote the PR body (resolution table + evidence pinned to `b9059b2`), marked it ready, and labelled it `ready-to-merge`.
- Blockers / follow-ups: no live baseline yet (Mahesh's first run). OPS-H4 (AC5 + CI for the 47 tests), RET-1 (production ordering), EVAL-2 re-scoped with QA r3 nits as AC6–AC9, and a pm-lead PRD §8 docs PR after merge.

## 2026-11-02 — EVAL-1 — in QA (round 3)
- Agent: ai-engineer · Attempts: 3 · PR: https://github.com/MaheshPulivarthi18/ArxivLens/pull/2 (draft, head `d83a4c0`) · Jira KAN-8 (not touched this session)
- Summary: paper-level Recall@5 (ADR-0006) gated, chunk_precision@5 diagnostic only. Gated mode follows ADR-0010 (search.go SQL pool of 20, one cross-encoder call, stable sort, top 5). Coverage requires embeddings for the current model. Tests check /healthz runs before any rerank. 47 tests pass; 17/17 mutants killed.
- Blockers / follow-ups: no live eval (no infra); production matches the gate only after RET-1. RET-1 must keep `test_rrf_pool_sql_mirrors_search_go` in sync. R3-7/R3-8 pm-lead. Diff is over 400 lines.

## 2026-11-02 — OPS-H3 + REPO-SPLIT — merged
- Agent: orchestrator, at Mahesh's request ("review thoroughly and merge") · PRs: ArxivLens #8 → 18a3cf9, #6 → 72c82ac (both squash)
- Summary: two fresh-context reviewers ran in parallel. #8: MERGE WITH FOLLOW-UPS. The rename bypass, empty-diff exit,
  nested AGENTS/CLAUDE files, `.env.example`, `services/embedder/*.py` and CONTRIBUTING inaccuracies were all fixed in the
  PR before merge and re-tested. #6: MERGE WITH FOLLOW-UPS. Behaviour preservation was proved with an old-vs-new
  equivalence test, and the PR description's evidence table was repaired. ArxivLens `main` is now code-only.
- Blockers / follow-ups: OPS-H3 follow-ups and #8 nits are in the board backlog; EVAL-1 (#2) is still in rework round 3 via the sprint.

## 2026-11-02 — REPO-SPLIT + EVAL-1 review triage — shipped
- Agent: orchestrator (with Mahesh in chat) · PR: ArxivLens cleanup PR (see board) · arxivlens-agents first commit
- Summary: Mahesh approved splitting the repos. arxivlens-agents now holds PRDs, ADRs, designs, tickets, board, QA
  evidence and agent rules; ArxivLens keeps code, tests, evals and CI. Mahesh's review of PR #2 was triaged. He decided
  ADR-0006 (paper-level Recall@5 gated, chunk precision@5 as a diagnostic) and ADR-0010 (production reranks a pool and
  sorts by rerank score). EVAL-1 is unblocked with a round-3 checklist, and RET-1 is created for the production change.
- Blockers / follow-ups: EVAL-1 round 3 (ai-engineer) → QA r3 → PM → raise; RET-1 needs design first.

## 2026-11-02 — OPS-H3 — in review (ready to merge)
- Agent: backend-engineer · Attempts: 1 · QA rounds: 1 (PASS) · PM rounds: 1 (APPROVE) · PR: https://github.com/MaheshPulivarthi18/ArxivLens/pull/6 · Jira KAN-15
- Summary: first Go tests in the repo: `ExtractCleanArxivID` (14 cases), `parseAtomFeed` extracted + fixture test (ING-7 version split), `retryBackoff` extracted + 200/400 ms test. pm-lead fixed the spec before build (it described behaviour the code doesn't have). CI green on Go 1.25.
- Blockers / follow-ups: F1 `go test -cover` in CI, F2 more pinning tests, F3 old-style arXiv IDs (product decision).

## 2026-11-02 — PM-1 — in review (ready to merge)
- Agent: pm-lead · Attempts: 1 · QA rounds: 2 (FAIL → PASS) · PM rounds: 1 (APPROVE, self-review caveat) · PR: https://github.com/MaheshPulivarthi18/ArxivLens/pull/3 · Jira KAN-21
- Summary: QA round 2 confirmed the QA-4 truthfulness fix; all ACs hold. Raised for review with evidence in the description.
- Blockers / follow-ups: merge after #2. Next PM docs pass: PM-1 AC1 prose, AI-2 AC5 (restore QA-4 ✅), bump §6 verified date.

## 2026-11-02 — EVAL-1 — blocked
- Agent: ai-engineer · Attempts: 2 · QA rounds: 2 (PASS → FAIL) · PM rounds: 1 (APPROVE, overturned by human review) · PR: https://github.com/MaheshPulivarthi18/ArxivLens/pull/2 · Jira KAN-8
- Summary: Mahesh's review found 2 blockers + 1 major after it was raised. Rework f750bb9: gated rerank mode now calls production `/internal/rerank` (fails closed), per-paper coverage. QA r2 FAIL: Recall@5 definition still precision@5-like (needs ADR-0006) and `/v1/ask` never sorts by rerank score, so the gate still ≠ user ordering.
- Blockers / follow-ups: Mahesh decides ADR-0006 and the rerank-ordering question. EVAL-2 needs re-scoping. Commits f750bb9/4f888fb (and PM-1 830fe69/b5c733f) carry a stale Claude-Session trailer (cosmetic).

## 2026-11-02 — board-2026-11-01 record (PR #4) — superseded
- Agent: orchestrator · Its commit is carried into this cycle's record branch; PR #4 is superseded by #7; Mahesh can close it without merging (the agent was not allowed to close PRs).

## 2026-11-01 — PM-1 — in review
- Agent: pm-lead · Attempts: 1 · Review rounds: 2 (CHANGES → APPROVE) · PR: https://github.com/MaheshPulivarthi18/ArxivLens/pull/3
- Summary: PRD §6 acceptance column (UI-5 → ◐), §8 metrics → evals/ + `make eval`, §9 concrete reference hardware (Proposed), all open questions → ADRs; new Proposed ADR-0006..0009; specs OPS-H4, OPS-H5, AI-2, AI-3, EVAL-2.
- Blockers / follow-ups: review caught an unlabelled gating policy in §9 (now Proposed). Mahesh to decide §9 + ADR-0006..0009. After PR #2 merges remove AGENTS.md §5 eval gotcha.

## 2026-11-01 — EVAL-1 — in review
- Agent: ai-engineer · Attempts: 1 · Review rounds: 2 (CHANGES → APPROVE) · PR: https://github.com/MaheshPulivarthi18/ArxivLens/pull/2
- Summary: evals/ datasets (34 retrieval / 22 answer / 22 refusal, 31-paper corpus), thresholds = PRD §8, `scripts/eval_gate.py` (fails closed), dataset-driven `evaluate_retrieval.py`, stdlib `evaluate_answers.py`, 20 no-infra tests.
- Blockers / follow-ups: review caught failed /v1/ask calls not affecting gated metrics (fixed). No live baseline (no infra in sandbox) — Mahesh to run. AC5 `.gitignore` → OPS-H4. make test-unit/lint only verifiable in CI this cycle.

## 2026-11-01 — SETUP — shipped
- Agent: human + setup · Attempts: 1 · Review rounds: 0 · PR: (this PR)
- Summary: Added agent team (4 roles), memory layout (`agents/`), ADRs 0001–0005 as Proposed, initial backlog of 10 tasks, Makefile harness, CI.
- Blockers / follow-ups: Human to decide ADR-0001..0005. QA-8 waits on ADR-0001/0002.

## 2026-11-03 09:15 IST — orchestrator (interactive)
- EVAL-1: PR #2 squash-merged at Mahesh's request after a final check (CI 4/4 green, 47 eval tests pass locally, no workspace files or secrets in the diff) → `a959d03`. Jira KAN-8 → Done. Unblocks the RET-1 (#9) merge, OPS-H4 and AI-4.
- Scheduled sprint task recreated with both repos attached (old one could not push to arxivlens-agents); old task disabled.

## 2026-11-03 — AI-1 — ready to merge
- Agent: pm-lead · PM rounds: 1 (APPROVE) · QA rounds: 1 (PASS) · PR: https://github.com/MaheshPulivarthi18/ArxivLens/pull/10 (raised, ready for review) · head `f56f80b`
- Summary: Final review of `rag.go` unit tests + splitter abbreviation fix. All 9 evidence files checked; CI 4/4 green; `rag.go` 97.9% (scratch, identical files), 25/25 mutants killed. QA finding 4 → ADR-0011 (Proposed) + AI-5 (Blocked on ADR-0011). Splitter note added to QA-8. pm-lead lesson on naming per-file coverage measurement.
- Blockers / follow-ups: Mahesh decides ADR-0011. Product PRD QA-5 → ◐ in the next pm-lead docs PR.
