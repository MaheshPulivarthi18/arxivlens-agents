## 2026-11-02 — OPS-H3 + REPO-SPLIT — merged
- Agent: orchestrator, at Mahesh's request ("review thoroughly and merge") · PRs: ArxivLens #8 → 18a3cf9, #6 → 72c82ac (both squash)
- Summary: two fresh-context reviewers ran in parallel. #8: MERGE WITH FOLLOW-UPS. The rename bypass, empty-diff exit,
  nested AGENTS/CLAUDE files, `.env.example`, `services/embedder/*.py` and CONTRIBUTING inaccuracies were all fixed in the
  PR before merge and re-tested. #6: MERGE WITH FOLLOW-UPS. Behaviour preservation was proved with an old-vs-new
  equivalence test, and the PR description's evidence table was repaired. ArxivLens `main` is now code-only.
- Blockers / follow-ups: OPS-H3 follow-ups and #8 nits are in the board backlog; EVAL-1 (#2) is still in rework round 3 via the sprint.

## 2026-11-02 — REPO-SPLIT + EVAL-1 review triage — shipped
- Agent: orchestrator (with Mahesh in chat) · PR: ArxivLens cleanup PR (see board) · arxivlens-agents first commit
- Summary: Mahesh approved splitting the repos. arxivlens-agents now holds PRDs, ADRs, designs, tickets, board, QA
  evidence and agent rules; ArxivLens keeps code, tests, evals and CI. Mahesh's review of PR #2 was triaged. He decided
  ADR-0006 (paper-level Recall@5 gated, chunk precision@5 as a diagnostic) and ADR-0010 (production reranks a pool and
  sorts by rerank score). EVAL-1 is unblocked with a round-3 checklist, and RET-1 is created for the production change.
- Blockers / follow-ups: EVAL-1 round 3 (ai-engineer) → QA r3 → PM → raise; RET-1 needs design first.

## 2026-11-02 — OPS-H3 — in review (ready to merge)
- Agent: backend-engineer · Attempts: 1 · QA rounds: 1 (PASS) · PM rounds: 1 (APPROVE) · PR: https://github.com/MaheshPulivarthi18/ArxivLens/pull/6 · Jira KAN-15
- Summary: first Go tests in the repo: `ExtractCleanArxivID` (14 cases), `parseAtomFeed` extracted + fixture test (ING-7 version split), `retryBackoff` extracted + 200/400 ms test. pm-lead fixed the spec before build (it described behaviour the code doesn't have). CI green on Go 1.25.
- Blockers / follow-ups: F1 `go test -cover` in CI, F2 more pinning tests, F3 old-style arXiv IDs (product decision).

## 2026-11-02 — PM-1 — in review (ready to merge)
- Agent: pm-lead · Attempts: 1 · QA rounds: 2 (FAIL → PASS) · PM rounds: 1 (APPROVE, self-review caveat) · PR: https://github.com/MaheshPulivarthi18/ArxivLens/pull/3 · Jira KAN-21
- Summary: QA round 2 confirmed the QA-4 truthfulness fix; all ACs hold. Raised for review with evidence in the description.
- Blockers / follow-ups: merge after #2. Next PM docs pass: PM-1 AC1 prose, AI-2 AC5 (restore QA-4 ✅), bump §6 verified date.

## 2026-11-02 — EVAL-1 — blocked
- Agent: ai-engineer · Attempts: 2 · QA rounds: 2 (PASS → FAIL) · PM rounds: 1 (APPROVE, overturned by human review) · PR: https://github.com/MaheshPulivarthi18/ArxivLens/pull/2 · Jira KAN-8
- Summary: Mahesh's review found 2 blockers + 1 major after it was raised. Rework f750bb9: gated rerank mode now calls production `/internal/rerank` (fails closed), per-paper coverage. QA r2 FAIL: Recall@5 definition still precision@5-like (needs ADR-0006) and `/v1/ask` never sorts by rerank score, so the gate still ≠ user ordering.
- Blockers / follow-ups: Mahesh decides ADR-0006 and the rerank-ordering question. EVAL-2 needs re-scoping. Commits f750bb9/4f888fb (and PM-1 830fe69/b5c733f) carry a stale Claude-Session trailer (cosmetic).

## 2026-11-02 — board-2026-11-01 record (PR #4) — superseded
- Agent: orchestrator · Its commit is carried into this cycle's record branch; PR #4 is superseded by #7; Mahesh can close it without merging (the agent was not allowed to close PRs).

## 2026-11-01 — PM-1 — in review
- Agent: pm-lead · Attempts: 1 · Review rounds: 2 (CHANGES → APPROVE) · PR: https://github.com/MaheshPulivarthi18/ArxivLens/pull/3
- Summary: PRD §6 acceptance column (UI-5 → ◐), §8 metrics → evals/ + `make eval`, §9 concrete reference hardware (Proposed), all open questions → ADRs; new Proposed ADR-0006..0009; specs OPS-H4, OPS-H5, AI-2, AI-3, EVAL-2.
- Blockers / follow-ups: review caught an unlabelled gating policy in §9 (now Proposed). Mahesh to decide §9 + ADR-0006..0009. After PR #2 merges remove AGENTS.md §5 eval gotcha.

## 2026-11-01 — EVAL-1 — in review
- Agent: ai-engineer · Attempts: 1 · Review rounds: 2 (CHANGES → APPROVE) · PR: https://github.com/MaheshPulivarthi18/ArxivLens/pull/2
- Summary: evals/ datasets (34 retrieval / 22 answer / 22 refusal, 31-paper corpus), thresholds = PRD §8, `scripts/eval_gate.py` (fails closed), dataset-driven `evaluate_retrieval.py`, stdlib `evaluate_answers.py`, 20 no-infra tests.
- Blockers / follow-ups: review caught failed /v1/ask calls not affecting gated metrics (fixed). No live baseline (no infra in sandbox) — Mahesh to run. AC5 `.gitignore` → OPS-H4. make test-unit/lint only verifiable in CI this cycle.

## 2026-11-01 — SETUP — shipped
- Agent: human + setup · Attempts: 1 · Review rounds: 0 · PR: (this PR)
- Summary: Added agent team (4 roles), memory layout (`agents/`), ADRs 0001–0005 as Proposed, initial backlog of 10 tasks, Makefile harness, CI.
- Blockers / follow-ups: Human to decide ADR-0001..0005. QA-8 waits on ADR-0001/0002.
